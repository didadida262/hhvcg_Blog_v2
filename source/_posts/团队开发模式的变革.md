### I've been using Cursor obsessively lately, which sparked some ideas so I want to share them here

`Conclusion first: with AI-assisted capability, one person becomes an entire team`

### The legacy development routine
`PRD + prototype + code`
- Product managers interview stakeholders, nail down requirements, and produce the PRD
- Designers coordinate with product to deliver the UI prototype
- Engineers align with product and design, clarify requirements, then schedule and start coding

This is the typical mainstream flow today (excluding tiny workshops). The whole process involves many roles and inevitably produces plenty of meetings, back-and-forth discussions, and alignment sessions—you know the drill.

**However**, after diving into Cursor and Claude recently for work, I suddenly realized that `this whole model might disappear at lightning speed`.

### Demo of development

Take a “management platform” project for example; the page looks like:

- `At the interaction level` the interface is clean, silky-smooth
- `At the code level` every module matches the requirements doc precisely. The code itself looks very professional—functions are carefully packaged and the comments are thorough

### Final takeaways

It’s not perfect, but a 90 out of 100 is still worth celebrating. `That project—from PRD clarification to final release—only took half a day. And a chunk of that was wasted fighting network issues.`

By leveraging AI, production speed skyrockets. There is a trending notion overseas called **“one-person company,”** and I believe that will become the future development model. The entire team might literally be one person, orchestrating everything through agents (frontend, backend, UI, DevOps, QA…). The person at the center of decision-making needs to focus on **direction, requirements, and goals**; the specific technical implementations become irrelevant. Of course, the practice still has its pain points—loop issues, mismatched descriptions vs. actual changes, lost-in-translation situations—and current AI tools may not yet reach our ideal level of perfection. But I believe that’s only a matter of time, because AI capability keeps evolving.

For frontline developers, this is both a challenge and an enormous opportunity. We need to shift our self-perception and gradually become “decision-makers.” Since today’s AI still cannot fully support **“natural language input → finished output,”** experienced developers who understand the entire delivery chain instantly become perfect conductors. **Mastering AI will be our future role.**

`The era of old-school programming is ending.` The author of *The Mythical Man-Month* would never have expected that years later, AI—nearly omnipotent—would deliver a true "silver bullet," **and we are entering a new generation at breakneck speed**.

### 最近沉迷使用Cursor，突然有了一些想法，想在这里分享一下

`结论先行：有了AI辅助能力，一个人就是一个团队`

### 传统的开发流程
`PRD + 原型 + 代码`
- 产品经理访谈相关方，确定需求，产出PRD
- 设计师配合产品，产出UI原型
- 工程师配合产品和设计，明确需求，然后排期，开始编码

这是目前典型的主流流程（排除小作坊）。整个过程涉及很多角色，不可避免地产生大量会议、来回讨论和对齐会议——你懂的。

**但是**，最近在工作中深入使用Cursor和Claude后，我突然意识到`这整个模式可能会以闪电般的速度消失`。

### 开发演示

以"管理平台"项目为例，页面效果如下：

<img src="/img/25918.gif" alt="Picture demonstration">

- `在交互层面`界面干净，丝滑流畅
- `在代码层面`每个模块都精确匹配需求文档。代码本身看起来很专业——函数精心封装，注释详尽

### 最终总结

虽然不完美，但90分仍然值得庆祝。`那个项目——从PRD明确到最终发布——只用了半天时间。而且其中很大一部分时间都浪费在解决网络问题上。`

通过利用AI，生产效率飙升。海外有一个趋势概念叫**"一人公司"**，我相信这将成为未来的开发模式。整个团队可能真的就是一个人，通过代理（前端、后端、UI、DevOps、QA…）协调一切。处于决策中心的人需要专注于**方向、需求和目标**；具体的技术实现变得无关紧要。当然，实践仍然有其痛点——循环问题、描述与实际变更不匹配、翻译丢失等情况——当前的AI工具可能还没有达到我们理想的完美水平。但我相信这只是时间问题，因为AI能力在不断进化。

对于一线开发者来说，这既是挑战，也是巨大的机遇。我们需要转变自我认知，逐渐成为"决策者"。由于今天的AI仍然无法完全支持**"自然语言输入 → 完成输出"**，理解整个交付链的经验丰富的开发者立即成为完美的指挥者。**掌握AI将是我们未来的角色。**

`旧式编程的时代正在结束。`《人月神话》的作者永远不会想到，多年后，AI——几乎无所不能——会带来真正的"银弹"，**我们正在以极快的速度进入新时代**。
