#### The Life-And-Death Landscape Woven By Sound And Image: Japanese Views On Life And Death Through Anime And Literature

In the cultural context of Japan, life and death have never been absolute boundaries of either-or, but rather **intertwined, mutually reflective symbiotic existences**. The soundtracks composed by **Yasuharu Takanashi** for *Shiki* and *Hell Girl*, with their melodies interweaving pathos and ethereality, establish the emotional foundation for the life-and-death narratives of these two anime series. The anime's portrayal of death as a daily occurrence and their profound questioning of karmic cycles and fate resonate with the death aesthetics found in the works of writers like **Yasunari Kawabata** and **Yukio Mishima**, collectively delineating the unique Japanese perspective on life and death—one that both **reveres the ultimate nature of death** while **dissolving the terror of death**, seeking a balance between life and death through the interweaving of sorrow and beauty.

The Japanese view on life and death first manifests in the **symbiotic recognition of "life and death sharing the same origin"**, which finds its ultimate expression in the plot and soundtrack of *Shiki*. In the isolated village of Sotoba, the invasion of the Shiki breaks down the barrier between humans and death. Death is no longer a distant endpoint but an existence that permeates daily life. The mysterious deaths of villagers one after another, from initial bewilderment to final resistance, reveal the transformation of death from "abnormal" to "normal"—a process that aligns with the Japanese literary tradition of treating death as part of everyday life. In Kawabata's *Snow Country*, Yoko's fatal fall contains no heart-wrenching wails, only the silent interweaving of snowflakes and flames, integrating death into natural scenery as a perceptible daily experience.

Takanashi's soundtrack **"Eau de Vie"** for *Shiki*, with its interweaving of urgent strings and deep drumbeats, depicts the irreconcilable survival conflict between humans and Shiki. Two life forms fight for existence, yet both fall into the predicament of fate—the survival order that humans defend will ultimately collapse, while the Shiki's pursuit of survival under sunlight remains an unattainable dream. **"Dead Sea"**, on the other hand, uses a serene melody to outline Seishin's inner struggle after witnessing life-and-death tragedies. His questioning of "order" precisely points to the Japanese confusion about the boundaries between life and death. This confusion manifests in Mishima's *The Temple of the Golden Pavilion* as the pursuit of "the beauty of destruction"—the act of burning down the Golden Pavilion is, in fact, an active breakthrough of the life-death boundary, achieving eternity through destruction.

The sense of **karmic cycles and fate** is another core of the Japanese view on life and death, which is vividly demonstrated in the plot and soundtrack of *Hell Girl*. The "Hell Correspondence" setting constructs a karmic closed loop of "revenge means mutual destruction": the client unties the red string, the enemy falls into hell, and their own soul will also be eternally damned after death. This "harm others, ultimately harm oneself" setting is not simple retribution for good and evil, but a profound inquiry into the cycle of life and death. **Enma Ai**, as a witness to the cycle, is herself the embodiment of karma—the injustice of being sacrificed by villagers in life transformed her into a vengeful spirit who slaughtered the village, ultimately becoming the Hell Girl, forever burdened with the fate of ferrying people to hell. Her existence confirms the fatalistic view of "life-death cycles and karmic retribution" in Japanese culture.

The soundtrack Takanashi created for *Hell Girl*, with the ethereality of the shakuhachi and the mournful quality of Japanese-style vocals, intensifies this sense of fate. The cold melody of the theme song's prelude, like the mist on the path to the underworld, draws viewers into the gray zone of "revenge and redemption." Each time revenge is achieved, the melody's sudden tightening conveys both the client's brief relief and foreshadows their eternal suffering after death. This emotional tension resonates with Mishima's view that "death is the continuation of life." In *The Decay of the Angel*, Mishima explores the theme that "the sins of life must be redeemed through death" through the protagonist's reincarnation, believing that the cycle of life and death is the only path to dissolve sin and achieve eternity.

The Japanese view on life and death ultimately rests on the **aesthetic pursuit of "sorrow and beauty interwoven."** Whether in anime or literature, death is not an ugly end but a carrier of beauty. In *Hell Girl*, the scene where Enma Ai sends enemies to hell, with its magnificent visual effects and mournful soundtrack, transforms death into a ritualistic aesthetic performance. The ending of *Shiki*, where the village turns to ashes in the fire, interweaves the horror of destruction with the hope of rebirth, creating a poignant beauty. This aesthetic pursuit reaches its peak in Kawabata's works, where death is always accompanied by natural beauty. In *Thousand Cranes*, the father's death merges with imagery of tea ceremony and cranes, becoming a pure yet melancholic aesthetic experience.

Takanashi's soundtrack is precisely the auditory transformation of this sorrow-beauty aesthetics. **"Higanbana"** (Red Spider Lily) in *Hell Girl*, with its gentle koto sounds and distant flute melodies, transforms the pathos of death into ethereal beauty. **"Epitaph"** in *Shiki* uses a heavy, sorrowful melody to speak of the equality of life and death—death is equally cruel to everyone, yet it also bestows upon life its final beauty. This ability to transform pathos into beauty is precisely the uniqueness of the Japanese view on life and death: they do not escape the pain of death but extract beauty from pain, dissolving the fear of death through beauty.

From the audio-visual narratives of *Shiki* and *Hell Girl* to the textual depictions of Japanese death literature, the Japanese view on life and death consistently revolves around three core themes: **"symbiosis, cycles, and sorrow-beauty."** Takanashi's soundtracks infuse emotional soul into life-and-death narratives, anime plots concretize abstract views on life and death into perceptible stories, while death literature provides the cultural foundation for this understanding. In their perception, death is not the opposite of life but its continuation; not a terrifying end but the sublimation of beauty. This view on life and death stems from Shinto's reverence for nature, Buddhism's belief in cycles, and a profound understanding of life's brevity, ultimately becoming a unique cultural imprint through the interweaving of sound, image, and text.

#### 声音与影像交织的生死图景：从动漫与文学看日本的生死观

在日本的文化语境中，生死从来不是非此即彼的绝对界限，而是**相互交织、相互映照的共生存在**。**高梨康治**为《尸鬼》和《地狱少女》创作的配乐，以其交织着悲情与空灵的旋律，为这两部动漫的生死叙事奠定了情感基础。动漫将死亡描绘为日常事件，对因果循环与命运的深刻追问，与**川端康成**、**三岛由纪夫**等作家作品中的死亡美学产生共鸣，共同勾勒出日本独特的生死观——既**敬畏死亡的终极本质**，又**消解死亡的恐怖**，通过悲与美的交织寻求生死的平衡。

日本的生死观首先体现在**"生死同源"的共生认知**，这在《尸鬼》的剧情和配乐中得到了极致表达。在封闭的外场村，尸鬼的入侵打破了人类与死亡之间的屏障。死亡不再是遥远的终点，而是渗透日常生活的存在。村民一个接一个的神秘死亡，从最初的困惑到最后的抵抗，揭示了死亡从"异常"到"正常"的转变——这一过程与日本文学传统中将死亡视为日常生活一部分的做法一致。在川端康成的《雪国》中，叶子的致命坠落没有撕心裂肺的哭喊，只有雪花与火焰的静默交织，将死亡融入自然风景，成为可感知的日常体验。

高梨康治为《尸鬼》创作的配乐**"生命之水"**，以其交织着急促弦乐与深沉鼓点的旋律，描绘了人类与尸鬼之间不可调和的生存冲突。两种生命形式为存在而战，却都陷入命运的困境——人类捍卫的生存秩序终将崩塌，而尸鬼在阳光下追求生存的梦想也遥不可及。**"死海"**则用宁静的旋律勾勒出静信在目睹生死悲剧后的内心挣扎。他对"秩序"的质疑，恰恰指向了日本人对生死界限的困惑。这种困惑在三岛由纪夫的《金阁寺》中表现为对"毁灭之美"的追求——烧毁金阁的行为，实际上是对生死界限的主动突破，通过毁灭达到永恒。

**因果循环与命运感**是日本生死观的另一个核心，这在《地狱少女》的剧情和配乐中得到了生动展现。"地狱通信"的设定构建了一个"复仇即相互毁灭"的因果闭环：委托人解开红绳，敌人坠入地狱，自己的灵魂死后也将永远受诅咒。这种"害人终害己"的设定不是简单的善恶报应，而是对生死循环的深刻追问。**阎魔爱**作为循环的见证者，本身就是因果的化身——生前被村民牺牲的不公将她转化为屠杀村庄的怨灵，最终成为地狱少女，永远背负着将人渡入地狱的命运。她的存在印证了日本文化中"生死循环与因果报应"的宿命论观点。

高梨康治为《地狱少女》创作的配乐，以其尺八的空灵与日式人声的悲怆，强化了这种命运感。主题曲前奏的冷峻旋律，如同通往冥界的迷雾，将观众拉入"复仇与救赎"的灰色地带。每次复仇达成时，旋律的突然收紧既传达了委托人的短暂解脱，也预示了他们死后永恒的苦难。这种情感张力与三岛由纪夫"死亡是生命的延续"的观点产生共鸣。在《天人五衰》中，三岛通过主人公的转世探索"生命之罪必须通过死亡来救赎"的主题，认为生死循环是消解罪恶、达到永恒的唯一路径。

日本的生死观最终落脚于**"悲与美交织"的审美追求**。无论是在动漫还是文学中，死亡都不是丑陋的终结，而是美的载体。在《地狱少女》中，阎魔爱将敌人送入地狱的场景，以其壮观的视觉效果和悲怆的配乐，将死亡转化为仪式化的审美表演。《尸鬼》的结局，村庄在烈火中化为灰烬，将毁灭的恐怖与重生的希望交织，创造出一种凄美的美感。这种审美追求在川端康成的作品中达到顶峰，死亡总是伴随着自然之美。在《千只鹤》中，父亲的死亡与茶道和鹤的意象融合，成为一种纯净而忧郁的审美体验。

高梨康治的配乐正是这种悲美美学的听觉转化。**"彼岸花"**在《地狱少女》中，以其柔和的筝音与遥远的笛声，将死亡的悲情转化为空灵的美。**"墓志铭"**在《尸鬼》中用沉重、悲怆的旋律诉说生死的平等——死亡对所有人都同样残酷，但它也赋予生命最终的美。这种将悲情转化为美的能力，正是日本生死观的独特性：他们不逃避死亡的痛苦，而是从痛苦中提取美，通过美消解对死亡的恐惧。

从《尸鬼》和《地狱少女》的视听叙事到日本死亡文学的文本描绘，日本的生死观始终围绕三个核心主题：**"共生、循环、悲美"**。高梨康治的配乐为生死叙事注入了情感灵魂，动漫剧情将抽象的生死观具象化为可感知的故事，而死亡文学则为这种理解提供了文化基础。在他们的感知中，死亡不是生命的对立面，而是其延续；不是恐怖的终结，而是美的升华。这种生死观源于神道对自然的敬畏、佛教对循环的信仰，以及对生命短暂性的深刻理解，最终通过声音、影像与文本的交织，成为一种独特的文化印记。 -->
