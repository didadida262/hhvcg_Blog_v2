### A study method that works for any discipline, language, or technical subject
- `Step 1 - Preparation`: find an authoritative book that covers most of the fundamentals
- `Step 2`: skim through the whole book quickly once
- `Step 3`: locate a reliable mentor, work through the course, and correct misunderstandings
- `Step 4`: break the material into chunks, then study each deeply in cycles
- `Step 5`: take a comprehensive test to verify you truly understand what you learned
- `Step 6`: keep cycling—practice and produce output. Above all, **do not waste the time you invested in the past**

Mastery comes down to one rule: **keep taking steps without stopping, and even a lame tortoise can travel a thousand miles; pile up grains of earth and before long a hill stands tall. In other words: only practice makes perfect.**
