### Keep it simple
Having been in development for four years and worked on plenty of projects, I suddenly had some thoughts about the product side.

It started when I noticed many domestic friends building independent sites and overseas ventures. After briefly getting involved, I realized that some shopping platforms can be extremely minimalist. Because of work, I got exposed to many overseas businesses. Compared with domestic projects, they share one glaring trait: `clean, flashy, and built on modern stacks`. Especially the web3 ones—”flashy“ is an understatement. Domestic projects, by contrast, feel straight-laced or even `old and stuck`. Their components are always the same old “three big ladies,” with very few highlights. Even Alibaba’s internal component library is mostly a business-tailored antd fork. From a product design viewpoint, there are almost no surprises. Ant Group’s Alipay has created many micro-interactions for mini-games, which does count as a creative design.

A product really boils down to two aspects: `functionality` and `design`. Domestically, the functional side is `big and comprehensive`, while on the design side the mantra is “just make it work.” Abroad, it’s more `small yet beautiful`—even a single button is `custom-built and highly tailored`. Sometimes I wonder, does a shopping platform truly need to be so comprehensive? Alipay or WeChat desperately crams everything inside—every kind of mini-program imaginable. Is that actually good? In a way, it becomes a monopoly.

So which philosophy is better: a `department store approach` or a `precision-targeted approach`? There’s no standard answer, but personally I lean toward the latter from a functional perspective. Because it’s simple, people like it. I also prefer overseas UI styles. Stiff design equals no design at all. I believe the future lies in this `small yet exquisite, keep it simple` product philosophy.
