### Keep it simple
Having been in development for four years and worked on plenty of projects, I suddenly had some thoughts about the product side.

It started when I noticed many domestic friends building independent sites and overseas ventures. After briefly getting involved, I realized that some shopping platforms can be extremely minimalist. Because of work, I got exposed to many overseas businesses. Compared with domestic projects, they share one glaring trait: `clean, flashy, and built on modern stacks`. Especially the web3 ones—”flashy“ is an understatement. Domestic projects, by contrast, feel straight-laced or even `old and stuck`. Their components are always the same old “three big ladies,” with very few highlights. Even Alibaba’s internal component library is mostly a business-tailored antd fork. From a product design viewpoint, there are almost no surprises. Ant Group’s Alipay has created many micro-interactions for mini-games, which does count as a creative design.

A product really boils down to two aspects: `functionality` and `design`. Domestically, the functional side is `big and comprehensive`, while on the design side the mantra is “just make it work.” Abroad, it’s more `small yet beautiful`—even a single button is `custom-built and highly tailored`. Sometimes I wonder, does a shopping platform truly need to be so comprehensive? Alipay or WeChat desperately crams everything inside—every kind of mini-program imaginable. Is that actually good? In a way, it becomes a monopoly.

So which philosophy is better: a `department store approach` or a `precision-targeted approach`? There's no standard answer, but personally I lean toward the latter from a functional perspective. Because it's simple, people like it. I also prefer overseas UI styles. Stiff design equals no design at all. I believe the future lies in this `small yet exquisite, keep it simple` product philosophy.

<!-- ### 保持简单
开发四年，做了不少项目，突然对产品侧有了一些思考。

起因是注意到很多国内朋友在做独立站和海外创业。短暂接触后，发现有些购物平台可以极简。因为工作原因，接触了很多海外业务。相比国内项目，他们有一个明显的特征：`干净、炫酷，基于现代技术栈`。尤其是web3的，用"炫酷"来形容都算轻了。国内项目相比之下，感觉比较死板，甚至`老旧、固化`。他们的组件总是那老三样，很少有亮点。就连阿里巴巴内部的组件库，也大多是业务定制的antd分支。从产品设计角度看，几乎没有惊喜。蚂蚁集团的支付宝为小游戏创造了很多微交互，这确实算是一种创意设计。

产品其实就两个方面：`功能`和`设计`。国内，功能侧是`大而全`，设计侧则是"能用就行"。国外，更多是`小而美`——甚至一个按钮都是`定制化、高度定制`。有时候我在想，一个购物平台真的需要这么全面吗？支付宝或微信拼命把所有东西都塞进去——各种能想象到的小程序。这真的好吗？在某种程度上，它变成了一种垄断。

那么哪种理念更好：`百货商店式`还是`精准定位式`？没有标准答案，但我个人从功能角度倾向于后者。因为简单，人们喜欢。我也更喜欢海外的UI风格。僵硬的设计等于没有设计。我相信未来在于这种`小而精，保持简单`的产品理念。 -->
